description=The plugin fragments the remote sensing image, to be used as deep learning training datasets.

about=Deep learning has achieved unprecedented accuracy in a variety of fields, including remote sensing. But not every remote sensing professional has a strong programming background, which is the required skill for practising deep learning. While enough material and sample code for deep learning applications are available in online repositories, pre-processing the remote sensing datasets to reach the training stage is still a tedious task and requires programming knowledge. Proprietary options to pre-process the data only on mouse clicks are available. However, access to such licensed software is often expensive and hence limited for a large population of researchers and practitioners. The plugin bridges the gap by enabling users to generate training samples in the form of image chips for deep learning application.
